# Car Garage

## Installation instructions

1. Clone the project to your `~/wcci/source_code` directory.
1. Open the project in Visual Studio and get started.

## Instructions

1. Open test files and add the Act, Arrange, and Assert portions of the test to match the test name and instructions.
1. Write production code to make the tests pass.
1. Make a console application with an instance of a `Garage` for your user to interact with.

### Things to keep in mind

1. **ALL** I/O (input and output) should come through the `Program` class.
1. **ALL** logic for the application should be located in the appropriate class (`Garage` or `Car`).
1. `Car`s should be identified uniquely (assume 'users' will provide unique identifiers of some sort).
1. Users should **ONLY** be interacting with individual `Car`s through the `Garage`.
